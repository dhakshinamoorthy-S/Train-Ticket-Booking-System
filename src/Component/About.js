    The first railway proposals for India were made in Madras in 1832. India's first railway line was named Red Hill Railroad and was built by Arthur Cotton to transport granite for road-building. It ran from the Red Hills in Chennai to the Chintadripet bridge in Madras and was opened on 12 September 1837.This railway, the first on the Indian Subcontinent, was only used for freight transport. In 1845, the Godavari Dam Construction Railway was built by Cotton at Dowleswaram in Rajahmundry, to supply stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River. In 1851, the Solani Aqueduct Railway was built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani River. These railway tracks were dismantled after each project was completed and no longer exist
